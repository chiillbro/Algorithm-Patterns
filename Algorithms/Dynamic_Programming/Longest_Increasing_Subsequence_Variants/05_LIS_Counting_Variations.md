**Pattern 5: LIS - Counting Variations (e.g., Number of LIS)**

- **Problem Statement:** Instead of just the length of the LIS, or one instance of an LIS, we need to count _how many distinct_ LIS of the maximum possible length exist.
- **Keywords:** "number of longest increasing subsequences", "count distinct LIS".
- **Core Idea:**
  1.  Use two DP arrays:
      - `lengths[i]`: Stores the length of the LIS ending with `nums[i]` (standard LIS).
      - `counts[i]`: Stores the number of distinct LIS that have length `lengths[i]` and end with `nums[i]`.
  2.  When considering `nums[i]` and a previous `nums[j]` (where `nums[j] < nums[i]`):
      - If `nums[i]` forms a _new longer_ LIS using `nums[j]` (i.e., `lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]`):
        - Update `lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1`.
        - The number of ways to form this new LIS ending at `i` is the same as the number of ways to form the LIS ending at `j`. So, `counts[i] = counts[j]`.
      - If `nums[i]` forms an LIS of the _same current max length_ for `i` using `nums[j]` (i.e., `lengths[j] + 1 == lengths[i]`):
        - `lengths[i]` doesn't change.
        - We've found _additional_ ways to achieve this length. So, `counts[i] += counts[j]`.
  3.  The final answer is the sum of `counts[k]` for all `k` where `lengths[k]` is equal to the overall maximum LIS length found.

**Explanation of `find_number_of_lis` Specifics:**

- `lengths = [1] * n`, `counts = [1] * n`:
  - Base case: Each element `nums[i]` itself is an LIS of length 1, and there's 1 way to form it.
- Outer loop `for i in range(n)`: Iterates through each element `nums[i]`, which we are trying to determine `lengths[i]` and `counts[i]` for.
- Inner loop `for j in range(i)`: Iterates through all elements `nums[j]` that come before `nums[i]`.
- `if nums[j] < nums[i]`: Standard LIS condition â€“ `nums[i]` can follow `nums[j]`.
- `if potential_new_length_at_i > lengths[i]`:
  - This is a _better_ (longer) LIS ending at `nums[i]`.
  - `lengths[i]` is updated.
  - `counts[i]` is set to `counts[j]`. Any previous ways of counting for `nums[i]` (which were for a shorter LIS) are now irrelevant for _this specific `lengths[i]`_.
- `elif potential_new_length_at_i == lengths[i]`:
  - This path provides an LIS ending at `nums[i]` of the _same length_ as what we've already found to be the maximum for `nums[i]`.
  - `counts[i]` is incremented by `counts[j]` because we've found `counts[j]` _new, distinct paths_ to achieve this `lengths[i]` for `nums[i]`.
- `max_lis_length = max(lengths) if lengths else 0`: Finds the global maximum LIS length.
- `total_count_of_max_lis = sum(...)`: Iterates through the `lengths` array. If `lengths[k]` is equal to the `max_lis_length`, it means `nums[k]` can be the end of an overall LIS. We add `counts[k]` (the number of ways this LIS ending at `nums[k]` can be formed) to our final sum.

- **Example Problems:**
  - [LeetCode 673: Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/)
- **Complexity:**
  - Time: O(N^2) - Due to the nested loops.
  - Space: O(N) - For the `lengths` and `counts` arrays.
- **Important Considerations:**
  - The distinction between the `>` and `==` conditions when updating `lengths` and `counts` is crucial.
  - This O(N^2) approach is standard. An O(N log N) solution exists but is much more complex, typically involving segment trees or Fenwick trees to query sums of counts for subsequences of a certain length ending with values less than `nums[i]`.
