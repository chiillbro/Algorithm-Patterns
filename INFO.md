**Essential Algorithms/Patterns for Top PBC Interviews**

Based on current trends for top product-based companies (MAANG, etc.), here's a list of crucial areas to focus on:

**I. Core Data Structures (Need Deep Understanding & Usage)**

1.  **Arrays & Strings:** (Fundamental) Basic operations, dynamic arrays, multi-dimensional arrays. String manipulation techniques.
2.  **Linked Lists:** Singly, Doubly, Circular. Operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, reversal). Detecting cycles (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare / Fast & Slow Pointers).
3.  **Stacks:** LIFO principle. Applications (parsing, backtracking, expression evaluation, monotonic stack).
4.  **Queues:** FIFO principle. Applications (BFS, level-order traversal, rate limiting simulation). Deques (Double-Ended Queues).
5.  **Hash Maps / Hash Sets (Dictionaries/Sets):** O(1) average time complexity for insertion, deletion, lookup. Crucial for optimizing time complexity. Understanding hash functions, collision resolution (conceptual).
6.  **Trees (General):** Terminology (root, node, edge, parent, child, leaf, height, depth).
7.  **Binary Trees:** Traversal methods (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder - recursive & iterative), Level Order Traversal (using Queues/BFS).
8.  **Binary Search Trees (BST):** Property, search, insertion, deletion, validation. Balanced BSTs (AVL, Red-Black - conceptual understanding is usually enough, not implementation).
9.  **Heaps (Priority Queues):** Min-Heap, Max-Heap. `insert`, `extract_min/max`, `peek`. Applications (Top K elements, Median finding, Dijkstra's, Huffman coding). Often implemented using arrays.
10. **Tries (Prefix Trees):** Efficient prefix searching, insertion, deletion. Applications (autocomplete, dictionary lookup, IP routing).
11. **Graphs:** Representations (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix). Terminology (vertex, edge, directed, undirected, weighted, cycle).

**II. Core Algorithm Techniques & Paradigms**

12. **Sorting:** Know common algorithms, their time/space complexity, and when to use them (Merge Sort, Quick Sort - understand partitioning, Heap Sort). Know built-in sort stability. (O(n log n) comparison sorts). Non-comparison sorts like Radix/Counting sort (O(n+k)).
13. **Searching:** Binary Search (on sorted arrays, answer spaces, finding first/last occurrence, rotated arrays).
14. **Two Pointers:** (You have this) Converging, Fast/Slow (Linked Lists, Arrays), Fixed distance apart.
15. **Sliding Window:** (You have this) Fixed size, Variable size (optimizing for max/min, count).
16. **Recursion & Backtracking:** Solving problems by breaking them down. Base cases are crucial. Exploring all possibilities systematically (subsets, permutations, combinations, N-Queens, Sudoku). Pruning search space.
17. **Dynamic Programming (DP):**
    *   **Core Idea:** Overlapping subproblems & optimal substructure. Memoization (Top-Down) vs. Tabulation (Bottom-Up).
    *   **Common Patterns:**
        *   1D DP (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, House Robber)
        *   2D DP (Unique Paths, LCS, Knapsack, Edit Distance)
        *   DP on intervals, trees, digits, bitmask DP (more advanced).
18. **Greedy Algorithms:** Making locally optimal choices hoping for a global optimum. Proving greedy choice validity can be tricky. (Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, Kruskal's, Prim's, Dijkstra's).
19. **Divide and Conquer:** Break problem into smaller subproblems, solve recursively, combine results (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search conceptually).

**III. Graph Algorithms (Very Frequent)**

20. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Level-order traversal. Finding shortest paths in *unweighted* graphs. Use a Queue.
21. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Exploring as deep as possible. Recursive or iterative (using a Stack). Applications (cycle detection, topological sort, finding connected components, flood fill).
22. **Topological Sort:** Ordering nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based on dependencies. (Using DFS or Kahn's Algorithm/BFS).
23. **Shortest Path Algorithms:**
    *   **Dijkstra's:** Single source shortest path in *weighted* graphs with *non-negative* edge weights. Use a Min-Priority Queue (Heap).
    *   **Bellman-Ford:** Single source shortest path, handles *negative* edge weights, detects negative cycles. Slower than Dijkstra's. (Less common in standard interviews but good to know).
    *   **Floyd-Warshall:** All-pairs shortest paths. O(V^3). (Less common).
24. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Finding a subset of edges connecting all vertices with minimum total edge weight.
    *   **Prim's Algorithm:** Greedy, grows tree from a starting node (often uses Priority Queue).
    *   **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Greedy, sorts edges and adds non-cycle-forming edges (often uses Union-Find).
25. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU):** Efficiently track sets of disjoint elements. Supports `union` and `find` operations (with path compression and union by rank/size optimizations). Used in Kruskal's, detecting cycles, connected components dynamically.

**IV. Other Important Concepts & Skills**

26. **Bit Manipulation:** Understanding bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`). Useful for optimizing certain problems, working with sets/flags, low-level manipulation.
27. **Mathematical Concepts:** Basic Number Theory (primes, GCD, LCM, modular arithmetic), Combinatorics (permutations, combinations), Probability basics.
28. **Complexity Analysis:** Big O notation (Time and Space). Analyzing iterative and recursive algorithms. Understanding average vs. worst case. Amortized analysis (conceptual).
29. **Problem Decomposition:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
30. **Edge Case Handling:** Thinking about empty inputs, single-element inputs, constraints, potential overflows.
31. **Communication:** Clearly explaining your thought process, approach, trade-offs, and code during an interview.

**How to Prioritize:**

*   **Fundamentals First:** Master Data Structures (especially Hash Maps, Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Heaps, Graphs) and core techniques (Sorting, Searching, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Recursion).
*   **Graphs & DP:** These are often considered intermediate-to-hard and are very frequent in PBC interviews. Spend significant time here. BFS/DFS are non-negotiable. Master 1D/2D DP patterns.
*   **Practice Widely:** Solve problems across all these categories on platforms like LeetCode, filtering by company tags and topic tags.
*   **Understand Trade-offs:** Don't just memorize algorithms; understand *why* you choose one over another based on constraints and requirements (time vs. space, weighted vs. unweighted, etc.).

Good luck!
