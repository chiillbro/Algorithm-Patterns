## üëã Introduction

Welcome to the Algorithm Patterns & Data Structures Playbook! This repository serves as a curated collection of common algorithm patterns, techniques, data structure implementations, and explanations frequently encountered in coding interviews, competitive programming, and software development.

The goal is to provide clear, concise, and practical templates and examples to help solidify understanding and speed up problem-solving.

## üìö Structure

The repository is organized into top-level categories:

*   **/Algorithms**: Contains explanations and templates for various algorithmic techniques.
*   **/Data\_Structures**: (Future) Will contain explanations and potentially implementations of common data structures.

Within `/Algorithms`, patterns are grouped by technique:

*   `Sliding_Window/`
*   `Two_Pointers/`
*   *(More categories like Dynamic_Programming, Graphs, etc., will be added over time)*

Each pattern or concept is typically documented in its own Markdown (`.md`) file, including:
*   Keywords to identify the pattern.
*   The core idea or intuition.
*   A reusable code template (often in Python but can refer as pseudocode!).
*   Example problems where the pattern is applicable.
*   Time and Space Complexity analysis.

## ‚ú® Content Overview (Current)

*   **Sliding Window:**
    *   Fixed-Size Window
    *   Variable-Size Window (Max/Min Length)
    *   Variable-Size Window (Count Subarrays)
    *   "At Most K" Trick (for Exactly K)
*   **Two Pointers:**
    *   Converging Pointers (Sorted Array)
    *   *(More patterns like Fast/Slow Pointers to be added)*

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Browse:** Navigate through the `Algorithms` directory based on the technique you want to study.
2.  **Learn:** Read the Markdown file for a specific pattern to understand its concepts and see the template.
3.  **Practice:** Try implementing the template yourself and solving the example problems listed.
4.  **Reference:** Use this repository as a quick reference when tackling new problems.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, find errors, or want to add new patterns, data structures, or examples, please feel free to:

1.  **Open an Issue:** Discuss the change you want to make or report a bug/typo.
2.  **Submit a Pull Request:**
    *   Fork the repository.
    *   Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingPattern`).
    *   Make your changes, ensuring consistency with the existing structure and style.
    *   Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add: AmazingPattern explanation'`).
    *   Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingPattern`).
    *   Open a Pull Request back to this repository.

Please ensure your contributions are well-documented and adhere to the general structure.
